# SpyCam with Android app
Spy cam created on Raspberry Pi supported by the android Application.
The main purpose of this work was to create a spycam and a mobile application based on the Android system that would enable remote control. 
It was assumed that the camera will be used to observe animals in their natural environment.
The Raspberry Pi platform and the Python programming language were used to design and implement it.
The main function of the device is to take pictures and send them to the user's e-mail address with simultaneous notification of the camera's activity. 
Photos are placed on Google's disk. The spycam communicates via bluetooth with the Android application,
which allows the user to choose one of several functionalities, such as:
* the type of camera activity (photo / series of photos or video), 
* e-mail to which the user will receive notification and the 
* option to add an attachment to mail in the form of a registered image.


Folder 'Raspberry Pi' has the python code that supports Raspberry Pi and Spy Cam.
